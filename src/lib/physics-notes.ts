# Chapter: Physical Quantities and Measurement

## 1. Introduction
In physics, we describe the world using physical quantities—properties of objects or phenomena that can be measured and expressed numerically. From the length of a pencil to the electric current in a wire, every measurable attribute is a physical quantity. A clear understanding of what physical quantities are, how they’re classified, and how we measure them is fundamental to all of physics.

## 2. Definition of a Physical Quantity
A physical quantity is a property of a physical system that can be quantified by measurement and expressed as a number multiplied by a unit. It has two parts:

- **Numerical value** (how many?)
- **Unit** (of what?)

**Example:** The mass of a book might be 0.5 kg, where 0.5 is the numerical value and kilogram (kg) is the unit.

## 3. Classification of Physical Quantities
### 3.1 Fundamental (Base) Quantities
These are quantities chosen by convention, independent of other quantities. In the International System of Units (SI), there are seven:

| Quantity | Symbol | SI Unit | Unit Symbol |
|---|---|---|---|
| Length | l | meter | m |
| Mass | m | kilogram | kg |
| Time | t | second | s |
| Electric current | I | ampere | A |
| Thermodynamic temperature | T | kelvin | K |
| Amount of substance | n | mole | mol |
| Luminous intensity | Iᵥ | candela | cd |

### 3.2 Derived Quantities
Derived quantities are defined in terms of base quantities through mathematical relations. For example:

- **Velocity** (v = length/time = l/t) has units m/s
- **Force** (F = ma, mass × acceleration) has units kg·m/s² = newton (N)

## 4. Units of Measurement
### 4.1 SI Units
The SI system ensures consistency worldwide. Every base unit has a precise definition (e.g., the metre is defined by the distance light travels in 1/299,792,458 of a second).

### 4.2 Other Systems
- **CGS System** (centimetre–gram–second): uses cm, g, s
- **Imperial System**: uses feet, pounds, seconds, etc.
Today, science and most engineering use SI exclusively.

## 5. Standards and Calibration
Accurate measurement requires standard references:

- Prototype meter bar (historical) → now light-based definition
- International Prototype Kilogram (IPK) → redefined in terms of Planck’s constant
- Atomic clocks for precise time

Laboratories use calibration to ensure instruments measure correctly against these standards.

## 6. Measurement: Precision, Accuracy, and Errors
### 6.1 Accuracy vs. Precision
- **Accuracy:** How close a measurement is to the true value.
- **Precision:** How repeatable measurements are (closeness of repeated readings).

### 6.2 Types of Errors
- **Systematic Error:** Causes measurements to be consistently off (e.g., a mis-calibrated scale).
- **Random Error:** Scatter in measurements due to unpredictable fluctuations (e.g., reading a stopwatch).

### 6.3 Reducing Errors
- Calibrate instruments
- Take multiple readings and average
- Use proper technique (e.g., parallax correction when reading scales)

## 7. Significant Figures
When recording measurements, only digits known reliably plus one estimated digit are written. This reflects the instrument’s precision.

Rules:
- Non-zero digits are always significant.
- Leading zeros are not significant.
- Trailing zeros in a decimal number are significant.

**Example:** 0.00420 m has three significant figures (4, 2, and the trailing 0).

## 8. Scalar and Vector Quantities
| Type | Definition | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| Scalar | Magnitude only | temperature (30 °C), mass (2 kg) |
| Vector | Magnitude and direction | displacement (5 m east), force (10 N downward) |

Vector addition via the parallelogram rule or component-wise (e.g., A⃗ + B⃗ = (Aₓ + Bₓ)ı̂ + (Aᵧ + Bᵧ)ȷ̂).

## 9. Dimensional Analysis
Every physical equation must be dimensionally consistent—both sides must have the same dimensions. Dimensions use symbols like [L] for length, [M] for mass, and [T] for time.

Example Check: s = ut + ½at²
- s has dimensions [L]
- ut has [L/T] × [T] = [L]
- at² has [L/T²] × [T²] = [L]

Since each term is [L], the equation is dimensionally valid.

## 10. Summary
- Physical quantities combine a numerical value with a unit.
- Base quantities form the foundation; derived quantities build on them.
- All measurements use standardized SI units, defined precisely.
- Accuracy, precision, and errors are key to reliable data.
- Significant figures reflect instrument precision.
- Quantities can be scalars or vectors, and equations must pass dimensional analysis.

## 11. Practice Questions
1. Classify the following as scalar or vector: volume, velocity, energy, acceleration.
2. A car travels 120 km in 2 h. Calculate its average speed and express with correct significant figures.
3. Verify dimensional consistency of the formula for kinetic energy: K = ½mv².
4. Explain one method to reduce random errors in timing experiments using a stopwatch.

# Chapter: Elasticity

## 1. Introduction
Elasticity is the property of a material that enables it to regain its original shape and size after the removal of deforming forces. It is a fundamental concept in mechanics, crucial for understanding how solids respond to stretching, compressing, and shearing.

## 2. Stress and Strain
**Stress (σ):** Internal force per unit area resisting deformation.
σ = F/A
where F = applied force, A = cross-sectional area.
Unit: pascal (Pa) = N/m².

**Strain (ε):** Measure of deformation, defined as the change in dimension divided by original dimension.
ε = ΔL / L₀
where ΔL = change in length, L₀ = original length.
Strain is dimensionless.

## 3. Hooke’s Law
For many materials under small deformations, stress is proportional to strain:
σ = Eε
E = Young’s modulus (modulus of elasticity in tension/compression).

Valid up to the elastic limit—beyond which permanent (plastic) deformation occurs.

## 4. Types of Elastic Moduli
| Modulus | Definition | Formula | Units |
|---|---|---|---|
| Young’s modulus E | Tensile (or compressive) elasticity | E = σ/ε | Pa |
| Bulk modulus K | Volumetric elasticity (resistance to uniform compression) | K = -V(dP/dV) ≈ ΔP / (ΔV/V) | Pa |
| Shear modulus G | Elasticity under shear forces | G = τ/γ | Pa |

*τ = shear stress; γ = shear strain (angular deformation).*

## 5. Stress–Strain Curve
A typical curve for a ductile material under tension:
- **Proportional Limit:** End of purely linear (Hookean) behavior.
- **Elastic Limit:** Maximum stress for which material returns fully on unloading.
- **Yield Point:** Onset of plastic (permanent) deformation.
- **Ultimate Tensile Strength:** Maximum stress sustained.
- **Fracture Point:** Material breaks.

**Key regions:**
- **OA:** Linear (σ ∝ ε).
- **AB:** Yielding with little increase in stress.
- **BC:** Strain hardening.
- **CD:** Necking leading to failure.

## 6. Energy Stored (Strain Energy)
Area under the stress–strain curve up to ε:
U = ∫₀^ε σ dε

For linear region:
U = (1/2) * σ * ε = (1/2) * E * ε²
Unit: J/m³.

## 7. Factors Affecting Elasticity
- **Material Type:** Metals, polymers, ceramics differ widely in E, G, K.
- **Temperature:** Generally, E decreases with increasing temperature.
- **Impurities/Alloying:** Alloy composition can strengthen (increase E) or embrittle.

## 8. Applications
- **Springs:** Designed using Hooke’s law (F = kx, where spring constant k = EA/L).
- **Structural Engineering:** Beams and columns rely on known moduli for deflection calculations.
- **Acoustics:** Bulk modulus governs speed of sound in materials (v = √(K/ρ)).

## 9. Summary
- Elastic behavior: Reversible deformation under load.
- Stress & strain: Quantify internal force and deformation.
- Hooke’s law: Linear relation up to elastic limit.
- Elastic moduli: E, G, and K describe resistance to tension, shear, and compression.
- Energy storage: Area under stress–strain curve.

2. Explain the difference between elastic limit and yield point.
3. Derive the expression for strain energy per unit volume in a material obeying Hooke’s law.
4. How does temperature affect the elasticity of a metal rod?

# Chapter: Gravitation

## 1. Introduction
Gravitation is the force of attraction that exists between any two masses. It governs the motion of planets, stars, galaxies, and even objects on Earth. Understanding gravitation lays the foundation for classical mechanics, astronomy, and space science.

## 2. Newton’s Law of Universal Gravitation
Every point mass attracts every other point mass with a force that:
- Is directly proportional to the product of their masses.
- Is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.

Mathematically:
**F = G * (m1 * m2) / r^2**
Where:
- **F**: Gravitational force (N)
- **m1, m2**: Masses (kg)
- **r**: Distance between centers (m)
- **G**: Universal gravitational constant (6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2)

## 3. Gravitational Field and Field Strength
- **Gravitational Field (g):** A region of space around a mass where another mass experiences a force.
- **Field Strength (g):** Force per unit mass at a point in the field.

**g = F / m  =>  g = G * M / r^2**
- **Direction:** Toward the mass M.
- **Unit:** N/kg (equivalent to m/s²).

## 4. Gravitational Potential and Potential Energy
- **Potential (ϕ):** Work done per unit mass to bring a test mass from infinity to a point in the field.

**ϕ = -G * M / r**
(Negative because work is done by the field.)
- **Unit:** J/kg.

- **Potential Energy (U):** Work done to assemble a system of masses from infinity. For two masses:

**U = -G * (m1 * m2) / r**
- **Unit:** J.

## 5. Acceleration Due to Gravity on Earth
Near Earth’s surface (r ≈ R_earth):

**g = G * M_earth / R_earth^2 ≈ 9.81 m/s^2**
This value can vary slightly with altitude and latitude.

## 6. Motion under Gravity
### 6.1 Free Fall
An object released from rest accelerates downward at 'g'.
Equations of motion:
- **v = g * t**
- **s = (1/2) * g * t^2**

### 6.2 Projectile Motion
Horizontal and vertical motions are independent.
- Vertical motion under 'g'.
- Horizontal motion at constant velocity.

## 7. Orbits and Kepler’s Laws
Objects bound by gravity move in conic sections (circles, ellipses, parabolas, hyperbolas). For planets around the Sun, elliptical orbits apply.

- **Kepler’s First Law:** Planets move in ellipses with the Sun at one focus.
- **Kepler’s Second Law:** A line connecting a planet to the Sun sweeps out equal areas in equal intervals of time.
- **Kepler’s Third Law:** T^2 is proportional to a^3, where T = orbital period, a = semi-major axis.

Combining with Newton’s gravitation gives:
**T^2 = (4 * π^2 / (G * M)) * a^3**

## 8. Escape Velocity
Minimum speed needed to escape from a planet’s gravitational field without further propulsion:
**v_esc = sqrt(2 * G * M / R)**
For Earth: v_esc ≈ 11.2 km/s.

## 9. Gravitational Effects in Astrophysics
- **Tides:** Differential gravity on near and far sides of Earth causes ocean tides.
- **Black Holes:** Regions where escape velocity exceeds the speed of light.
- **Galactic Rotation:** Evidence for dark matter from rotation curves.

## 10. Summary
- Gravitation is a universal attractive force between masses.
- It follows an inverse-square law with constant G.
- It defines fields (g), potentials (ϕ), and energy (U).
- It governs free-fall, projectile motion, and orbital dynamics.
- Key concepts include Kepler’s laws, escape velocity, and tidal effects.

## 11. Practice Questions
1. Calculate the gravitational force between Earth (6.0 x 10^24 kg) and a 70 kg person standing on its surface.
2. Derive the expression for orbital speed 'v' of a satellite in a circular orbit of radius 'r'.

## 1. Introduction
Vectors are quantities that have both magnitude and direction, unlike scalars which have only magnitude. They’re essential for describing physical quantities like displacement, velocity, and force.

## 2. Representation of Vectors
- **Graphical:** As an arrow—length is proportional to magnitude, arrowhead points in the direction.
- **Analytical:** By components in a coordinate system. In two dimensions:
  **A⃗ = Aₓı̂ + Aᵧȷ̂**
  where **Aₓ = Acos(θ)** and **Aᵧ = Asin(θ)**.

  **A⃗ × B⃗** is the determinant of the matrix:
  | ı̂ | ȷ̂ | k̂ |
  |---|---|---|
  | Aₓ | Aᵧ | A₂ |
  | Bₓ | Bᵧ | B₂ |

## 4. Unit Vectors and Direction Cosines
- A **unit vector (û)** has magnitude 1. For a vector **A⃗**, its unit vector is **Â = A⃗ / A**.
- **Direction cosines** are the cosines of the angles between a vector and the coordinate axes:

# Chapter: Kinematics (Rectilinear Motion)

## 1. Introduction
Kinematics is the branch of mechanics that describes motion without considering its causes. For one-dimensional motion under constant acceleration, a set of key equations governs position, velocity, and time.

## 2. Key Quantities
- **Displacement (s or x):** The change in position of an object.
- **Velocity (v):** The rate of change of displacement. **v = ds/dt**
- **Acceleration (a):** The rate of change of velocity. **a = dv/dt**

## 3. Equations of Motion (for constant acceleration 'a')
Given initial velocity **u**, final velocity **v**, constant acceleration **a**, displacement **s**, and time **t**:
1.  **v = u + at**
2.  **s = ut + (1/2)at²**
3.  **v² = u² + 2as**
4.  **s = (1/2)(u + v)t**

## 4. Graphical Analysis of Motion
- **Position–time graph:** The slope (gradient) gives the velocity.
- **Velocity–time graph:** The slope gives the acceleration, and the area under the graph gives the displacement.
- **Acceleration–time graph:** The area under the graph gives the change in velocity.

## 5. Special Cases
- **Free fall:** An object falling under gravity has a constant downward acceleration **a = g ≈ 9.81 m/s²**.
- **Vertical projection:** For an object thrown upwards, we often take the upward direction as positive, so **a = -g**.

# Chapter: Dynamics (Newton’s Laws)

## 1. Introduction
Dynamics explains *why* objects move as they do. It is based on Newton's three fundamental laws of motion.

## 2. Newton’s Laws of Motion
1.  **First Law (Inertia):** An object remains at rest or in uniform motion in a straight line unless acted upon by a net external force.
2.  **Second Law (F = ma):** The acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting on it and inversely proportional to its mass. **∑F = ma**
3.  **Third Law (Action–Reaction):** For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. If object A exerts a force on object B, then object B exerts an equal and opposite force on object A.

## 3. Common Types of Forces
- **Gravitational Force (Weight):** W = mg, acting vertically downward near Earth’s surface.
- **Normal Force (N):** A contact force acting perpendicular to a surface.
- **Frictional Force (f):** A force that opposes motion or attempted motion. **f ≤ μN**.
- **Tension (T):** The force exerted by a string, rope, or cable.
- **Spring Force:** The force exerted by a spring, given by Hooke's Law (F = -kx).

## 4. Free-Body Diagrams
A free-body diagram is a crucial tool for solving dynamics problems:
1.  Isolate the object of interest.
2.  Draw all external forces acting *on* the object as vectors originating from the center.
3.  Choose a coordinate system and resolve forces into components.
4.  Apply Newton's Second Law to each axis: **∑Fₓ = maₓ** and **∑Fᵧ = maᵧ**.

## 5. Applications of Dynamics
- **Inclined Plane:** The weight (mg) is resolved into components: **mg sin(θ)** down the slope and **mg cos(θ)** perpendicular to the slope.
- **Atwood’s Machine:** For two masses (m₁, m₂) over a frictionless pulley, the acceleration is **a = (m₂ - m₁)g / (m₁ + m₂)**.
- **Uniform Circular Motion:** An object moving in a circle at constant speed has a net force, the centripetal force, directed towards the center: **F_c = mv²/r**.

## 6. Practice Questions
1. A block of mass 5 kg rests on a 30° incline. If the coefficient of kinetic friction is 0.2, find its acceleration down the plane.
2. Two masses, 3 kg and 5 kg, are connected by a light string over a frictionless pulley. Find the acceleration of the system and the tension in the string.
3. A 1 kg mass is attached to a spring with a spring constant of 200 N/m. If it is pulled 0.1 m from equilibrium and released, what is its maximum acceleration?

# Chapter: Work, Energy & Power

## 1. Introduction
This chapter connects the concepts of force and motion to energy and the rate at which energy is transferred.

## 2. Work
Work is done when a force causes a displacement.
- For a constant force **F** causing a displacement **s**, the work done is:
  **W = Fs cos(θ)**
  where θ is the angle between the force and displacement vectors.
- The general definition of work is **W = ∫ F⃗ ⋅ ds⃗**.
- **Unit:** joule (J). 1 J = 1 N·m.

## 3. Energy
Energy is the capacity to do work.
- **Kinetic Energy (K):** The energy of motion.
  **K = (1/2)mv²**
- **Potential Energy (U):** Stored energy due to position or configuration.
  - **Gravitational Potential Energy:** U = mgh
  - **Elastic Potential Energy (in a spring):** U = (1/2)kx²

## 4. Work–Energy Theorem
The net work done on an object equals the change in its kinetic energy.
**W_net = ΔK = K_final - K_initial = (1/2)mv² - (1/2)mu²**

## 5. Conservation of Mechanical Energy
If only conservative forces (like gravity and spring forces) do work, the total mechanical energy (K + U) of a system is conserved.
**K_initial + U_initial = K_final + U_final**
Non-conservative forces, like friction, dissipate mechanical energy.

## 6. Power
Power is the rate at which work is done or energy is transferred.
- **Average Power:** P_avg = W / Δt
- **Instantaneous Power:** **P = dW/dt = F⃗ ⋅ v⃗**
- **Unit:** watt (W). 1 W = 1 J/s.

## 7. Efficiency
Efficiency (η) is the ratio of useful energy output to the total energy input.
**η = (Useful Energy Output / Total Energy Input) × 100%**

## 8. Practice Questions
1. A 2 kg block is accelerated from 3 m/s to 7 m/s. Calculate the net work done on the block.
2. A 5 kg mass is lifted 2 meters vertically at a constant speed. How much work is done against gravity? If it is lifted in 4 seconds, what is the power developed?

# Chapter: Circular Motion

## 1. Introduction
Circular motion describes the movement of an object along a circular path. Even if the speed is constant, there is always an acceleration because the direction of velocity is changing.

## 2. Angular Quantities
Motion in a circle is often described using angular variables:
- **Angular Displacement (θ):** The angle swept by the radius vector. Unit: radians (rad).
- **Angular Velocity (ω):** The rate of change of angular displacement. **ω = dθ/dt**. Unit: rad/s.
- **Angular Acceleration (α):** The rate of change of angular velocity. **α = dω/dt**. Unit: rad/s².

## 3. Relationship between Linear and Angular Quantities
For a circle of radius **r**:
- Arc length **s = rθ**
- Tangential speed **v = rω**
- Tangential acceleration **a_t = rα**

## 4. Centripetal Acceleration and Force
- **Centripetal Acceleration (a_c):** The acceleration directed towards the center of the circle, responsible for changing the direction of the velocity vector.
  **a_c = v²/r = rω²**
- **Centripetal Force (F_c):** The net force required to cause centripetal acceleration. It always points towards the center of the circle.
  **F_c = ma_c = mv²/r = mrω²**
  This is not a new type of force; it is the *net result* of other forces (e.g., tension, gravity, friction).

## 5. Dynamics of Circular Motion
- Apply Newton's Second Law to the radial (centripetal) and tangential directions separately.
  - **∑F_radial = ma_c = mv²/r**
  - **∑F_tangential = ma_t**
- The tangential force component changes the object's speed. The centripetal force component changes its direction.

## 6. Applications
- **Banking of Curves:** Roads are banked at an angle θ so that the normal force provides the necessary centripetal force. For no friction, the ideal angle is given by **tan(θ) = v² / (rg)**.
- **Vertical Circles (e.g., roller coaster loop):** The required centripetal force is provided by the combination of gravity and the normal force (or tension). The minimum speed at the top to complete the loop is **v_top = √(rg)**.

## 7. Practice Questions
1. A 1000 kg car takes a flat turn of radius 50 m at a speed of 20 m/s. What is the minimum coefficient of static friction required between the tires and the road?
2. A 0.2 kg stone is whirled on a string in a horizontal circle of radius 0.5 m at a rate of 3 revolutions per second. Compute its angular velocity (ω), linear speed (v), and the tension in the string.
3. Calculate the ideal banking angle for a highway curve of radius 100 m if the designated speed is 25 m/s.

export const electricChargesNotes = `
# Chapter: Electric Charges
## 1. Introduction
Electric charge is a fundamental property of matter that gives rise to electric forces. There are two types of charge: positive and negative. Like charges repel; opposite charges attract.

## 2. Quantization and Conservation
- **Quantization:** Charge comes in integer multiples of the elementary charge e = 1.602 × 10⁻¹⁹ C.
- **Conservation:** The total electric charge in an isolated system remains constant.

## 3. Coulomb’s Law
The electrostatic force between two point charges q₁ and q₂, separated by distance r, is:
**F = k * |q₁q₂| / r²**
where k = 1 / (4πε₀) ≈ 8.99 × 10⁹ N·m²/C².
Direction is along the line joining the charges; it is repulsive if they have the same sign.

## 4. Superposition Principle
If multiple charges act on a test charge, the net force is the vector sum of the individual forces:
**F_net = Σ F_i**

## 5. Conduction, Induction, and Charging Methods
- **Conduction:** Direct contact transfers charge.
- **Induction:** Bringing a charged object near a conductor causes separation of charges without contact.
- **Friction:** Rubbing two materials (e.g., amber and wool) can transfer electrons.

## 6. Applications & Phenomena
- Electrostatic precipitators for pollution control.
- Lightning: Massive charge separation in clouds leading to discharge.

## 7. Practice Questions
1. Calculate the force between two +3 μC charges 5 cm apart.
2. Two charges, +Q and -Q, are 10 cm apart. Where along the line joining them is the net force on a third test charge zero?
`;

export const electricFieldNotes = `
# Chapter: Electric Field
## 1. Introduction
An electric field E describes the influence a charge exerts on the space around it. A test charge q placed in an electric field E experiences a force F = qE.

## 2. Definition
The electric field E at a point is the force F per unit charge q on a positive test charge:
**E = F / q**
Unit: newton per coulomb (N/C) or volt per meter (V/m).

## 3. Field of a Point Charge
The electric field from a single point charge q at a distance r is:
**E = k * q / r²**
The field is radial, pointing away from a positive charge and toward a negative charge.

## 4. Superposition
Electric fields from multiple sources add vectorially:
**E_net = Σ E_i**

## 5. Field Lines
- Lines originate on positive charges and terminate on negative charges.
- The density of lines is proportional to the field strength.
- Field lines never cross.

## 6. Uniform Electric Field
Between two large, parallel conducting plates with potential difference V separated by distance d, the field is approximately uniform:
**E ≈ V / d**

## 7. Gauss’s Law (Qualitative)
The net electric flux through any closed surface is equal to the total charge enclosed by that surface divided by ε₀:
**Φ_E = ∮ E ⋅ dA = Q_enclosed / ε₀**
This law is very useful for calculating the electric field for charge distributions with high symmetry.

## 8. Practice Questions
1. Sketch the electric field lines for (a) an isolated positive point charge, and (b) a pair of equal but opposite charges (an electric dipole).
2. Find the electric field at a point midway between two equal positive charges +Q separated by a distance 2a.

export const potentialDifferenceAndEnergyNotes = `
# Chapter: Electric Potential and Potential Energy

## 1. Electric Potential (V)
Electric potential is the work done per unit charge in bringing a positive test charge from infinity to a specific point in an electric field.
**V = W / q**
Unit: volt (V), where 1 V = 1 J/C.

For a point charge q, the potential at a distance r is:
**V = k * q / r**

## 2. Potential Difference (ΔV)
The potential difference between two points A and B is the work done per unit charge to move a charge from A to B.
**ΔV = V_B - V_A = W_AB / q**
A positive charge naturally moves from a region of higher potential to lower potential, losing electric potential energy.

## 3. Relation to Electric Field
The electric field is the negative gradient of the potential.
**E = -∇V**
In one dimension, this simplifies to **E_x = -dV/dx**. The field points in the direction of the steepest decrease in potential.

## 4. Equipotential Surfaces
These are surfaces where the electric potential is constant.
- No work is done when moving a charge along an equipotential surface.
- Electric field lines are always perpendicular to equipotential surfaces.

## 5. Electric Potential Energy (U)
The potential energy of a pair of point charges q₁ and q₂ separated by distance r is:
**U = k * (q₁q₂) / r**
The total potential energy of a system of charges is the sum of the energies of all unique pairs.

## 6. Applications
- **Capacitors:** Store energy in the electric field, given by **U = (1/2)CV²**.
- **Electron Volt (eV):** A unit of energy equal to the energy gained by an electron moving through a potential difference of 1 V. (1 eV = 1.602 × 10⁻¹⁹ J).

## 7. Practice Questions

# Chapter: Capacitors
## 1. Introduction
A capacitor is a device used to store electric charge and energy. It consists of two conductors (plates) separated by an insulator (dielectric).

## 2. Capacitance (C)
Capacitance is the ratio of the charge Q on one conductor to the potential difference V between the conductors.
**C = Q / V**
Unit: farad (F), where 1 F = 1 C/V.

## 3. Parallel-Plate Capacitor
For a capacitor with two parallel plates of area A separated by a distance d in a vacuum:
**C = ε₀ * A / d**
If a dielectric material with dielectric constant κ is inserted between the plates:
**C = κ * ε₀ * A / d = κ * C_vacuum**

## 4. Energy Stored in a Capacitor
The energy U stored in a charged capacitor is given by:
**U = (1/2) * Q² / C = (1/2) * CV² = (1/2) * QV**

## 5. Combination of Capacitors
- **In Series:** The total capacitance is the reciprocal of the sum of the reciprocals.
  **1/C_eq = 1/C₁ + 1/C₂ + ...**
  The charge on each capacitor is the same.

- **In Parallel:** The total capacitance is the sum of the individual capacitances.
  **C_eq = C₁ + C₂ + ...**
  The voltage across each capacitor is the same.

## 6. Dielectrics
A dielectric is an insulating material that, when placed in an electric field, becomes polarized. This reduces the net electric field inside the capacitor, allowing it to store more charge at the same voltage, thus increasing its capacitance.

## 7. Applications
- **Tuning circuits** in radios and TVs.
- **Energy storage** for flashes in cameras and defibrillators.
- **Filtering** in power supplies to smooth out voltage.

## 8. Practice Questions
1. A 10 μF capacitor is charged to a potential difference of 5 V. Calculate the charge on the capacitor and the energy stored in it.

For many materials (ohmic conductors), the voltage V across them is directly proportional to the current I flowing through them.
**V = I * R**
where R is the resistance. Unit: ohm (Ω).

## 3. Resistivity and Resistance
Resistance R depends on the material's properties and geometry:
**R = ρ * L / A**
where:
- **ρ (rho)** is the resistivity of the material (Ω·m).
- **L** is the length of the conductor.
- **A** is the cross-sectional area.

## 4. Electric Power
Power P is the rate at which energy is dissipated in a circuit component.
**P = V * I = I² * R = V² / R**
Unit: watt (W), where 1 W = 1 J/s.

## 5. Resistors in Series and Parallel
- **Series:** Resistors are connected end-to-end. The current is the same through each. The equivalent resistance is the sum:
  **R_eq = R₁ + R₂ + ...**

- **Parallel:** Resistors are connected across the same two points. The voltage is the same across each. The equivalent resistance is given by:
  **1/R_eq = 1/R₁ + 1/R₂ + ...**

## 6. Kirchhoff’s Laws
For complex circuits, these laws are essential:
1.  **Junction Rule (Conservation of Charge):** The sum of currents entering any junction must equal the sum of currents leaving that junction.
    **ΣI_in = ΣI_out**
2.  **Loop Rule (Conservation of Energy):** The sum of the potential differences (voltages) around any closed loop in a circuit must be zero.
    **ΣΔV_loop = 0**

## 7. EMF and Internal Resistance
A real battery has an electromotive force (EMF or ε) and an internal resistance (r). The terminal voltage V_T (the actual voltage supplied) is:
**V_T = ε - I * r**

## 8. Applications
- **Voltage Dividers:** Using series resistors to produce a specific output voltage.
- **Wheatstone Bridge:** A circuit used to accurately measure an unknown resistance.

## 9. Practice Questions
